# How execution is done ?

# Python is an interpreted language unlike C,C++ and others which are compiled 
# languages which are compiled on execution to machinecode
# which (.exe file) is then excuted by the computer hardware.

# Python being an hybrid language which does compilation and interpretation for its own advantages
# since In an interpreted language, the source code is not directly translated into machine code. 
# Instead, an interpreter reads and executes the code line-by-line.

# Java: Java code is compiled into bytecode by the Java compiler. 
# The bytecode is then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or 
# further compiled into machine code by the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.
# Python: Python code is compiled into bytecode (.pyc files), 
# which is then interpreted by the Python interpreter.
